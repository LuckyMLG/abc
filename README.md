# Teacher Rating Site

A simple website similar to Trustpilot where students can rate teachers.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The server stores data in memory so ratings will reset when the server restarts.
